## My Comments About the Article

I chose this article because I had always been somewhat confused about the difference between Docker and Kubernetes and how they fit into modern software development. Although I knew they were important tools in DevOps and cloud environments, I did not have a clear mental model of what each one actually does.

This article helped clarify that Docker is primarily used for packaging applications into portable containers, while Kubernetes is responsible for managing and orchestrating those containers at scale. Kubernetes handles tasks such as deployment, scaling, and recovery from failures. Learning about these features made me realize why these tools are essential in real-world production systems. 



### Comment by Dana Pantoja-Campa
This article is incredibly insightful for learning about Docker and its components. I have never used it before and although I knew it is used in deployment workflows, this article breaks down its core ideas and compares it with other concepts to strengthen understanding. Kubernetes handles these containerized applications at scale.
